        change event name, time, change memo content or tag name, add new event to an existing memo or tag,
        delete event from a memo or tag...
    * a part of the change function is already been written in main package, change class
    * we also plan to put a "today" function, which can help user to have a
        quick view of all today's events

Note:
* When input options, please use the correct format as the system described; otherwise, some exceptions may appear;
  We will try to fix this in phase2.
* Formats like "11-22-2020 11:00" is not acceptable because we only have 12 months
